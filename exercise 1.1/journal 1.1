Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python 
Learning Goals

Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

Reflection Questions

1. In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development?
 If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

2. Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future.
 Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice.
  How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team?
   Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 
(Hint: refer to the Exercise section “The Benefits of Developing with Python”)

3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement.
 You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you.
  What do you want to learn about Python? 
  What do you want to get out of this Achievement? 
  Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?


Question 1 - 
Front-end is what the user uses to interact with the web. These can include buttons, links, forms, animations, ect. using tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Back-end involves data storage and business logic. if a user's information is stored in a database, it is essential to have a back-end to
 communicate with the database to send and store information. there are alot of tools such as python, php, JavaScript, etc.
If hired for a backend job I would likey be working with databases, authentication and authorization, hashing sensitive information, APIs, ORM/ODMs

Question 2 -
Both JavaScript and python are high level languages that are dynamic typing. with python, the main benefit would be readabilty.
if the project keeps expanding and more devs need to look at the code base, it will be easier for devs to understand what is going on.
Also, python has built in package management and an active community updating python. 

Question 3 -
I want to better understand object oriented programming.
I want to learn how to write scripts to automate tasks.
I want to learn more about backend development.
