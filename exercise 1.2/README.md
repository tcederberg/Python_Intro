# Data types in Python

## Objective

Explain variables and data types in Python
Summarize the use of objects in Python
Create a data structure for your Recipe app

## Reasons for data type choice 

1.1 I picked a dictionary as I want to be able to store more types of data such as lists and tuples. This will allow for a variety of the information that can be stored for each recipe. 

1.3 I picked a list to store all of my lists as its internal elements can be added to, modified, rearranged, and deleted.
